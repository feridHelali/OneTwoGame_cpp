##Rock/Sesor/Paper Game with GUI

### Used graphic library: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
  we can use other more advanced full deature GUI SDK ie:Software Development Kit (like QT, wxWidgets, GTK+, MFC ) but I want to keep it simple for the students and focus on the game logic and basic graphics handling.
